# Cognifyz-internship
This repository contains the complete work done during my Web Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. Throughout the internship, I worked on a variety of web-based projects that strengthened my understanding of front-end development. My tasks involved designing and developing responsive, user-friendly web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on implementing clean layouts, interactive features, and mobile-optimized designs to improve overall user experience. The projects helped me gain hands-on experience in creating dynamic web components, handling DOM manipulation, and applying CSS styling techniques effectively. I also learned how to structure code efficiently, debug errors, and follow best practices in modern web development. This repository showcases all the assignments, tasks, and mini-projects completed during the internship, reflecting my growth in front-end development and my ability to build functional, visually appealing web interfaces.
